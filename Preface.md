# 前言

If you have worked in software engineering in recent years, especially in server-side

and backend systems, you have probably been bombarded with a plethora of buzz‐

words relating to storage and processing of data. NoSQL! Big Data! Web-scale!

Sharding! Eventual consistency! ACID! CAP theorem! Cloud services! MapReduce!

Real-time!

In the last decade we have seen many interesting developments in databases, in dis‐

tributed systems, and in the ways we build applications on top of them. There are

various driving forces for these developments:

• Internet companies such as Google, Yahoo!, Amazon, Facebook, LinkedIn,

Microsoft, and Twitter are handling huge volumes of data and traffic, forcing

them to create new tools that enable them to efficiently handle such scale.

• Businesses need to be agile, test hypotheses cheaply, and respond quickly to new

market insights by keeping development cycles short and data models flexible.

• Free and open source software has become very successful and is now preferred

to commercial or bespoke in-house software in many environments.

• CPU clock speeds are barely increasing, but multi-core processors are standard,

and networks are getting faster. This means parallelism is only going to increase.

• Even if you work on a small team, you can now build
